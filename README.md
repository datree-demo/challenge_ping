# Tanda Code Challenges - Pings

This was the challenge for back end developers/engineers. The challenge includes building a simple and stable server, 
data storage, and responding to HTTP requests.

I used JavaScript with Node.js as its environment to make the server. Ruby was used to run tests against the server.

## How to setup
1. Open command prompt
2. Go to the directory of the folder
3. Run main.js (node Main.js)
4. Open another command prompt
5. Go to the directory of the folder
6. Run pings.rb (ruby pings.rb)

### Development
* JavaScript
* Ruby (only used for running tests on the server)

### Environment
* Node.js

### Framework
* Express.js

### Editor
* Visual Studio Code
